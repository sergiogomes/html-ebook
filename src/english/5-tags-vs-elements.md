# Tags vs elements

I mentioned tags and elements. What's the difference?
Elements have a starting tag and a closing tag. In this example, we use the p starting and closing tags to create a p element:

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
```

So, an element constitutes the whole package:

- starting tag
- text content (and possibly other elements)
- closing tag

If an element doesn't have a closing tag, it is only written with the starting tag and cannot contain any text content.
That said, I might use the tag or element term in the book, meaning the same thing, except if I explicitly mention starting tag or ending tag.
