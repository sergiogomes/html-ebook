# Introduction

Welcome!
I wrote this book to help you quickly learn HTML and get familiar with advanced HTML topics.
HTML, a shorthand for Hyper Text Markup Language, is one of the Web's fundamental building blocks.
HTML was officially born in 1993. Since then, it has evolved into its current state, moving from simple text documents to powering rich Web Applications.
This ebook covers everything from beginner to professional
First, the beginner. I explain HTML from scratch concisely but comprehensively, so you can use this ebook to learn HTML from the ground up.
Then, the professional. HTML is often considered a secondary thing to learn.
Yet lots of things are obscure to many people. Me included. I wrote this handbook to help my understanding of the topic because when I need to explain something, I better make sure I first know the thing inside out.
Even if you don't write HTML in your daily work, knowing how HTML works can help save you some headaches when you need to understand it from time to time, for example, while tweaking a web page.
