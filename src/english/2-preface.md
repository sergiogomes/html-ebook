# Preface

HTML is the foundation of the marvel called the Web.
There is an incredible power underneath this relatively simple and limited set of rules, which lets us craft documents, apps, and experiences for people worldwide.
Despite being released in 1993, 20+ years have passed, and HTML is still the foundation of the Web, with minimal changes from then.
Sure, we got more semantic tags, presentational HTML is no longer a thing, and CSS has taken care of the design of things.
HTML is a success because of its simplicity.
It resisted being incorporated into an XML dialect via XHTML when eventually, people realized that thing was way too complex.
After you learn a couple of rules, you have a lot of freedom.
The web platform did one thing right: it always maintained backward compatibility. We can go back to HTML documents written in 1991, which look pretty much as they looked back.
We even know what the first web page was. It's this:
<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html>
And you can see the source of the page, thanks to another significant feature of the Web and HTML: we can inspect the HTML of any web page.
Don't take this for granted. I don't know any other platform that gives us this ability.
The exceptional Developer Tools built into any browser let us inspect and take inspiration from HTML written by anyone worldwide.
If you are new to HTML, this book aims to help you get started. This book will improve your knowledge if you are a seasoned Web Developer.
I learned so much while writing it, even though I've been working with the Web for 20+ years, and I'm sure you'll find something new, too.
Or you'll re-learn something old you forgot.
In any case, the book's goal is to be helpful to you, and I hope it succeeds.
