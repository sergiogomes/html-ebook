# Case insensitive

HTML is case insensitive. We can write Tags in all caps or lowercase. In the early days, caps were the norm. Today lowercase is the norm. It is a convention.
You usually write like this:

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
```

Not like this:

```html
<P>A paragraph of text</P>
```
