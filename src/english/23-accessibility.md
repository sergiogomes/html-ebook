# Accessibility

We must design our HTML with accessibility in mind.

Having accessible HTML means that people with disabilities can use the Web. There are totally blind or visually impaired users, people with hearing loss issues, and many other disabilities.

Unfortunately, this topic does not take the importance it needs and seems less cool than others.

What if a person can't see your page but wants to consume its content? First, how do they do that? They can't use the mouse; they use a `screen reader`. You don't have to imagine that. You can try one now: Google provides the free [ChromeVox Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn). Accessibility must also allow tools to select elements or navigate the pages easily.

We don't always build web pages and Web apps with accessibility as one of our first goals, and maybe version 1 is released not accessible, but it's possible to make a web page accessible after the fact. The Sooner, is better, but there is always time.

It's essential, and in my country, websites built by the government or other public organizations must be accessible.

What does this mean to make an HTML accessible? Let me illustrate the main things you need to think about.
